## Hard Gate

## Eval Files

- `evals/eval_cases.json`
- `evals/run_evals.py`
- `fixtures/scholarships/`

## Cases

The current fixture set has 12 eval cases:

- 3 eligible.
- 3 not eligible.
- 3 unclear.
- 3 unverified.

Each eval case includes:

- Student profile.
- Scholarship candidate.
- Source text fixture.
- Expected verdict.
- Expected source classification.
- Required evidence fields.
- Expected tool trajectory.

## Required Trajectory

1. `fetch_page`
2. `classify_source`
3. `extract_rules`
4. `match_profile`
5. `generate_verdict`
6. `write_audit_log`

## Automatic Failure Conditions

- `eligible` without `source_url`.
- `eligible` without official source.
- `eligible` with missing required evidence.
- Aggregator used as proof.
- Verdict generated before source classification.

## Offline Demo

Fixture mode is required so the demo works without live web search.
